<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

- In this first section I open a new ticket as the "User/Customer" that I configured named "Karen". The first picture shows how it would look like as a "User/Customer" creating the ticket, in the second and third picture it shows how the "Agent/Worker" will receive the ticket.

- In this second section it I will be assigning the ticket to its designated areas as an "Agent/Worker" in this case its "John Doe", from receiving this ticket and inspecting it I have concluded the "SLA" to be at a level "Sev-A" meaning its high severity. I assigned the ticket to the team "Online Banking" meaning anyone from the team can work the ticket, the department was set for "Support" and the help topic was set for "Report a problem/Business critical" which in this case is a high severity. Each of these areas have a note attached as well to give a better understanding to whoever will work the ticket which is shown in the second image below.

- In this third section I will be working the ticket as the "Agent/Worker" who took on the assignment in this case its "Jane Doe". In this first image it shows "Jane Doe" reaching out to the "Customer" by way of message, you can reach out by way of phone as well but in this example to show better representation i'll do it by way of message. Assuming we fixed the issue we send out a message to the "Customer" notifying them the problem was solved as show in the second image below.

- Assuming the issue was fixed and the customer verifies there is no more problems we set the status of the ticket to resolved which will close the ticket, and wont be on the ticket list as it no longer needs to be worked on.
